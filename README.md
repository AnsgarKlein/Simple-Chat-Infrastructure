Simple Chat (Server/Client) Infrastructure
==========================================

This is a simple chat server (+Client), which communicates with his client
over ethernet.

(Star Topology)

It is completely written in Java (+Swing for the client interface)

There aren't any dependencies that I know of other than java
(I use openjdk-7)

To install type:
        $ make
